#  UPLOAD TO GITHUB - FIXED!

##  What I Fixed

- Removed large node_modules folders
- Updated .gitignore to exclude large files
- Your folder is now small enough to upload!

##  What to Upload

Drag and drop the ENTIRE stem-sprouts-website folder to GitHub.

##  What Gets Uploaded

 All configuration files
 backend/server/ folder structure
 package.json files
 server.js code

##  What Gets Ignored (Not Uploaded)

 node_modules/ (too large)
 .env files (security)
 Log files
 Cache files

##  After Upload

1. Connect to Railway
2. Set OPENAI_API_KEY
3. Deploy successfully!

##  Why This Works

- Railway will run npm install to get dependencies
- No large files to cause upload issues
- Clean, production-ready code structure
